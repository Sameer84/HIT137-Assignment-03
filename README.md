Question 1 

Create a Tkinter application using the concepts of object-oriented 
programming, such as, multiple inheritance, multiple decorators, 
encapsulation, polymorphism, and method overriding, etc. 
Wherever you use these concepts in code, explain them using # (How they are 
linked to code).
Examples: 
• Youtube Like Interface Applications.
• Using single/multiple Open-Source AI models (smaller) to a create 
desktop application. Ex: An Image classification application, Language 
translation app, object detection app, facial recognition app, etc. 
(You just need to download the models and add its input points to the 
buttons in your tkinter application. Whatever the user enters into the 
application should go the AI model and give a output on the 
application.)

Question 2

Create a simple “side-scrolling” 2D game using Pygame. The game should
allow the player to control a character with the ability to run, jump, shoot 
projectiles. The game should have enemies, collectibles, and 3 levels. It should 
also have a scoring system, health, and lives. 
The game should include the following, but not limited to: 
• Player class (movements, speed, jump, health, lives) - Methods
• Projectile Class (movements, speed, damage) – Methods
• Enemy Class (……………….) – Methods
• Collectible Class (health boost, extra life, etc.,)
